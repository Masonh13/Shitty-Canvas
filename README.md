When code go code
Make make lemenade

I can generate a README file for your GitHub extension that makes Canvas worse. Here is a possible template that you can use or modify as you wish.

CanvasWorse
CanvasWorse is a browser extension that makes Canvas, the learning management system, worse in various ways. It is intended to be a humorous and harmless prank, not a malicious attack. Use it at your own risk and discretion.

Features
CanvasWorse can do the following things:

Randomly shuffle the order of assignments and quizzes on the dashboard
Replace the course names and icons with emojis
Add typos and grammatical errors to the course descriptions and announcements
Change the fonts and colors of the text and buttons to make them less readable
Play annoying sounds when you click on certain elements
Installation
CanvasWorse is compatible with Chrome and Firefox. To install it, follow these steps:

Download the latest release of CanvasWorse from here.
Unzip the file and extract the folder.
Open your browser’s extension manager and enable the developer mode.
Click on the “Load unpacked” or “Load temporary add-on” button and select the CanvasWorse folder.
Enjoy!
Usage
CanvasWorse is activated by default when you visit any Canvas site. To disable or enable it, click on the extension icon in your browser’s toolbar and toggle the switch. You can also customize which features you want to use by checking or unchecking the boxes.

Contributing
CanvasWorse is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from anyone who wants to make Canvas worse. If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug report, please open an issue or a pull request on GitHub.
